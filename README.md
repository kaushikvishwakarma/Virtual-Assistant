# Virtual Assistant in Python

### Overview
This Python-based virtual assistant project, initially created in 2022, leverages Google Text-to-Speech (`pyttsx3`) and `SpeechRecognition` to manage everyday tasks through voice commands. It serves as a hands-free assistant for tasks like web searches, music playback, and basic PC controls. Rediscovered recently, this project highlights the potential of Python libraries in creating a functional, personal assistant.

### Key Features
- **Personalized Greetings**: Offers time-based greetings (e.g., "Good Morning," "Good Evening") to create a friendly interaction experience.
  
- **Wikipedia & Web Searches**: Retrieves summaries from Wikipedia or executes Google searches directly on command.
  
- **YouTube Video Playback**: Enables hands-free YouTube search and video playback for entertainment or information.
  
- **Music Player**: Accesses and plays music from a designated directory on the userâ€™s PC.
  
- **Time & Date Queries**: Provides the current time or date on request.
  
- **Quick Access to Websites**: Opens commonly used websites like Google, YouTube, and Stack Overflow, making daily tasks easier.

- **Memory Feature**: Allows note-taking and reminder functionality by saving user commands in a file for future reference.
  
- **PC Controls**: Supports commands to shut down, restart, or cancel shutdowns with voice confirmation for added security.
  
- **Password-Protected File Access**: Secures access to specific files with a password prompt, providing extra protection for sensitive information.

### Tech Stack
Built using `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech, `SpeechRecognition` for command processing, `wikipedia` for retrieving summaries, `pywhatkit` for web-based tasks, and standard libraries like `os` and `webbrowser` for system interactions.

### How to Use
Clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the script. A microphone is required to capture commands, and specific directory paths may need customization for certain features.

### Future Enhancements
This project could be enhanced with modern NLP libraries, improved user interface options, and integration with more APIs to extend its functionality and responsiveness.

> **Note**: This project is set up as a personal assistant and may require adjustments based on individual system configurations and preferences.

Rediscovering this has inspired me to expand its potential. Excited to bring new updates to life!
